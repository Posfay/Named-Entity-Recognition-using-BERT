Homework for VITMAV45 by Team PBP: Alex Papp (JG18IB), Zalán Bokor (T0JVW9), Benedek Pósfay (CDJEOZ)

We are using hunNERwiki, a Hungarian corpus for Named Entity Recognition (NER). We are aiming to create and train a model for NER using transfer learning and BERT as a starting point. The python notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/Posfay/Named-Entity-Recognition-using-BERT/blob/main/Named_Entity_Recognition_using_BERT.ipynb).
